# Python Descriptive Statistics Project (Polars)

![Python CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/ids706-mini-project-3/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This project is focused on calculating descriptive statistics utilizing a Python setup with CI/CD implemented through GitHub Actions. The project has been updated to use the Polars library for more efficient data processing. It comes with a **.devcontainer** setup for streamlined development within a Docker container using Visual Studio Code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Local Development with VS Code and .devcontainer
1. Ensure **Docker** is installed and running on your machine.
2. Install the **Remote - Containers** extension in VS Code.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Open the repository in VS Code.
5. A notification will appear suggesting you reopen the project in a container. Click "Reopen in Container". (Alternatively, press **F1**, type "Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container", and press Enter.)
6. Initially, Docker will build an image based on the defined **Dockerfile**. This step might take a few minutes.
7. Once inside the container, a Python environment, isolated from your local system, is prepared for your use, with the Polars library ready to assist in data processing tasks.

### üß™ Running Tests

To initiate tests in this project, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This command runs all the unit tests and ensures that any changes made haven't introduced new issues.

üõ†Ô∏è File Structure
* src/main.py: The central script housing functions such as read_dataset, generate_summary_statistics, and create_data_visualization, now utilizing the Polars library for data management.
